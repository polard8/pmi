	two main layers:

	+ device drivers: generate events.
	+ handler:        handle these events.



from linux manual:

3.1 Device drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Device drivers are the modules that generate events. The events are
however not useful without being handled, so you also will need to use some
of the modules from section 3.2.

3.2 Event handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Event handlers distribute the events from the devices to userland and
kernel, as needed.
