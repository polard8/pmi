    The function __kgwm_ps2kbd_procedure() in kgwm.c is able to intercept
some special keyboard sequencies. We use this sequencies do switch the window
with focus. This way a user can switch the active widnow using the keyboard.

    With this function we can switch the window with focus using keyboard sequencies
for any foreground thread.
    The forground thread is the raw input thread.
