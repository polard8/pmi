    The Dispatcher and the Scheduler:
    ================================

    Dispatcher:
    The attribution of a dispatcher is context switch, task switch and spawn.
    Context Switching. Saving and restoring the context of a thread.
    Switching between threads.
    Switching to user mode, by jumping to the proper location 
    in the user program to restart that program.

    Scheduler:
    The scheduler will create the next round.
